# 2. Project Structure
## data/
The data repository contains the provided data from blackboard. This data is used for fitting the models and looking up restaurants.
It also contains the baseline_rules.json, which defines rules for the baseline model as well as the eval_results.csv, which is generated by running evaluate_models.py
## source/
### baseline.py

### config.py

## evaluate_models.py -> implements 1a
to run: 
```bash
python evaluate_models.py
```

This script generates a .csv-file which contains the performance metrics for each of the models. Each model is evaluate with and without the removal of duplicate utterances (TODO: What is removed again??). 

The default output path of this file is data/eval_results.csv and is hardcoded in the script.

## main.py -> implements 1a & 1b (dialog management)
to run: 
```bash
python main.py
```

This script fits a ML model on the data and uses the fitted model for the dialog management. Before the dialog is started, the user is asked to optionally change some configurations that influence the behavior/functionality of the dialog.
