# 1. Installation
After cloning the repository, the requirements need to be installed. This is done using a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# 2. Project Structure
## data/
The data repository contains the provided data from blackboard. This data is used for fitting the models and looking up restaurants.
It also contains the baseline_rules.json, which defines rules for the baseline model as well as the eval_results.csv, which is generated by running evaluate_models.py
## source/

### model.py
Here, the 'Model' class is defined. It serves as the parent class for the baseline models and machine learning models.
TODO: make naming more clear with the .predict()

It also provides the evaluate() method to generate metrics like accuracy, precision and recall.

### baseline.py
Inherits from Model class. TODO

### ml_model.py
Inherits from Model class. TODO

### datacreator.py
Defines the class Datacreator which handles the preprocessing of the data, generates the data splits and finally create the dataset.


### extend_csv.py
Extends the restaurant_info.csv provided on Blackboard by the required columns.


### restaurant_lookup.py


### dialog_management.py

# 3. Main Scripts
## evaluate_models.py -> implements 1a
to run: 
```bash
python evaluate_models.py
```

This script generates a .csv-file which contains the performance metrics for each of the models. Each model is evaluate with and without the removal of duplicate utterances (TODO: What is removed again??). 

The default output path of this file is data/eval_results.csv and is hardcoded in the script.

## main.py -> implements 1a & 1b (dialog management)
to run: 
```bash
python main.py
```

This script fits a ML model on the data and uses the fitted model for the dialog management. Before the dialog is started, the user is asked to optionally change some configurations that influence the behavior/functionality of the dialog.
